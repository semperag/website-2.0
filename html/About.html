        <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>My name is Adi, Iâ€™m a Software Engineer at DTIS. In 2022, I graduated from James Madison University where I studied Computer Science.</p>
        <p>Throughout my Junior and Senior year, I was a Teacher Assistant for the Computer Science Department. This meant I assisted students with various problems including core object-oriented concepts and debugging their own projects.</p>
        <p>In my spare, I am learning music composition, weightlifting, and I enjoy working on side-projects (like this website), learning new programming languages, and casually getting on OW. :)</p>
